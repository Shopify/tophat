/// applications.  An install session receives requests to launch applications and processes them.
///
/// While an install session is active, it can continuously receive requests to install applications. During
/// this period, downloads are cached so that repeated requests do not redownload the same resources
/// Install sessions are intended to be destroyed and recreated each time Tophat becomes idle, so that
/// future requests are not subject to caching and latest artifacts can be downloaded.
